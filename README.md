# weatherApp
A functional weather app using OpenWeatherMap's API utilizing JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
This was made following a tutorial, link here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIYQR-Ybrn4, with additional modifications made after.
This serves as a learning project as I work towards a higher level of proficiency in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
